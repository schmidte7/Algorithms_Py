Chapter1: Live in day tight compartments:
In the spring of 1871, a young man picked up a book and read 21 words that had a profound effect in his future, a medical student at the Montreal General Hospital, he was worried about passing the final examination, he worried about what to do, about where to go, how to build up a practice, how to make a living.
The 21 words that this young medical student read in 1871 helped him to become the most famous physician of his generation, he organized the world famous John Hopkins’ school of medicine, he became Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, the highest honor that can be bestowed upon any medical man in the British empire. He was knighted by the king of England.
When he died, two huge volumes containing 1466 pages were required to tell the story of his life. His name was Sir William Osler. Here are the 21 words that he read in the spring of 1871, 21 words from Thomas Carlyle that helped him live a life free of worry: ‘’Our main business is not to see what dimly lies at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand!’’
